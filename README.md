# Heart Disease Prediction using Neural Networks

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging neural networks to predict heart disease based on patient attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart rate. By employing machine learning techniques, we aim to classify patients into different categories of coronary artery disease severity. The dataset utilized comprises information from 303 patients, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Motivation

In the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare, the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force. This project serves as a practical demonstration of the application of advanced algorithms in medical diagnostics. By familiarizing oneself with data processing techniques tailored for health data and utilizing widely adopted classification algorithms, we contribute to the ongoing discourse in this critical domain.

## Dependencies

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- keras

You can install these dependencies using the provided code snippet:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn keras
```

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Access it [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease).

### Description

The dataset contains comprehensive patient data pertaining to heart disease diagnosis, collected from diverse geographical locations. It encompasses a rich array of attributes, including demographic information, physiological parameters, and lifestyle factors. Notably, published studies leveraging this dataset typically focus on a subset of 14 attributes, primarily data collected at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.

### Usage

To utilize the dataset, import it using the `read_csv()` function provided by the pandas library:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv("heart_disease_dataset.csv")
```
